### Run conformance tests

- Start the conformance tests on your test host

```shell
sonobuoy run \
  --mode=certified-conformance \
```

You can monitor the conformance tests by tracking the sonobuoy logs. Wait for the line no-exit was specified, sonobuoy is now blocking, which signals the end of the testing.

```shell
sonobuoy logs -f
```

Upon completion of the tests you can obtain the results by copying them off the sonobuoy pod.

```shell
OUTPUT_PATH=$(sonobuoy retrieve)
echo ${OUTPUT_PATH}
mkdir ./results
tar xzf ${OUTPUT_PATH} -C ./results
```
