## To reproduce:
This Kubernetes conformance report is generated by Kubernetes on CAIH Container Cloud.

### Provision the Kubernetes cluster
To recreate these results, first you need to create a Kubernetes cluster on CAIH Container Cloud.

Run CAIH Container Cloud, Follow below installation to install the latest CAIH Container Cloud release.  

1.Download  and deploy CAIH Container Cloud with command:
```shell
mkdir -p /app
cd /app
git clone http://bitbucket.caih.local/scm/caihcloud/caih-cloud-ansible.git
mv caihcloudinstall ansible-k8s
cd /app/ansible-k8s/
sh 000.setup.sh
```
After the creation completed, add the test cluster and launch the Kubernetes e2e conformance tests.

## Run the Kubernetes conformance tests

The standard tool for running these tests is [Sonobuoy](https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy).
Sonobuoy is regularly built and kept up to date to execute against all currently supported versions of kubernetes, 
and can be obtained [here](https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy/releases).

Download the CLI by running:

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/heptio/sonobuoy
```

Deploy a Sonobuoy pod to your cluster with:

```
$ sonobuoy run
```

View actively running pods:

```
$ sonobuoy status
```

To inspect the logs:

```
$ sonobuoy logs
```

Once `sonobuoy status` shows the run as `completed`,
copy the output directory from the main Sonobuoy pod to a local directory:

```
$ sonobuoy retrieve .
```

This copies a single `.tar.gz` snapshot from the Sonobuoy pod into your local `.` directory.
Extract the contents into `./results` with:

```
mkdir ./results; tar xzf *.tar.gz -C ./results
```

**NOTE:** The two files required for submission are located in the tarball under **plugins/e2e/results/{e2e.log,junit.xml}**.

To clean up Kubernetes objects created by Sonobuoy, run:

```
sonobuoy delete
```
